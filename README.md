# How to Add Your Work


1. **Fork the repository**  
   - On the original repo page, click the **Fork** button at the top right.  
   - This creates a copy of the repo in *your* GitHub account.

2. **Go to your forked repo**

   - Click **Add file** → **Create new file**.  
   - In the filename box, type your folder name followed by a slash `/` and then the filename (e.g., `ayesha-sketches/README.md`).  
   - This creates the folder automatically.  
   - You can add files like `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, `.zip`, `.pdf`, screenshots, or GIFs inside your folder by creating more files or uploading them.

4. **Upload your files**

   - Click **Commit changes** to save your work in your fork.

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR) to the original repo**  
   - Go to the original repo page.  
   - You’ll see a **Compare & pull request** button for your fork’s recent changes — click it.
